    CSS Syntax:
    selector {
    property: value;
    }

    We can target items to style in different ways
    1) by tag name
    2) by id: #idname
    3) by class name: .classname

    Classes and ids are developer defined
    IDs are intended to be used once per page, but classes are
    designed to be used as often as needed.

    CSS is case sensitive.

    We can incorporate CSS into our HTML pages in 3 ways
    1) INLINE styling - use the style attribute on a particular tag.
    2) INTERNAL Stylesheets - use style tags in the head element of the page
    3) EXTERNAL Stylesheets - use link tags in the head that point to a CSS stylesheet

    NOTE: IMPORTING style sheets - uses an @import at the top of an external
    stylesheet to link two stylesheets together. This practice is largely deprecated
    but you could see it in legacy code.

    We can target items to style in different ways
    1) target by tag name - most generic
    2) target by class name (.className) - more specific
    a. class selectors are denoted by a period
    b. they can be used as often as needed
    c. they are applied to html tags using the class attribute
    ex. <h1 class="alert">Alert</h1>
    3) target by id name (#IdName)
    a. id selectors denoted by a #
    b. should only be used once per page (unique identifiers)
    c. applied to HTML tags using the id attribute
    ex. <h1 id="Alert">Alert</h1>

                    <h2 class="headingStyle">Inline Style</h2>

                    Inline styles use the STYLE attribute inside an HTML tag...

                    Usually avoided (except for formatting assigned through JavaScript)

                    because it's not reusable. Uses semi-colon-separated, CSS property-value

                    pairs in the style attribute's value.

                    Highest in terms of proximity and specificity, least re-usable.

                    <h2 class="headingStyle">Internal Style</h2>

                    Internal style is defined inside the HEAD tag of a page

                    (not header tag). Reusuability is only for that page. Not often used.

                    Second in terms of proximity and specificity is determined by selectors used in each rule set.

                <section>

                    <h2 class="headingStyle">External Style</h2>

                    External style is defined as a link inside the HEAD block of a page

                    (not header). Actual styles are in that linked CSS file.

                    Reusuability can be for whole site. Best practice.

                    Least in terms of proximity and specificity is determined by selectors used in each rule set.

                    <h2 class="headingStyle">Imported Style</h2>

                    Imported style is defined as an import url() statement at the top

                    of an external style sheet. Actual CSS is in that linked CSS file.

                    Reusuability is for the whole site. This practice is largely depricated but can be seen in legacy code.
