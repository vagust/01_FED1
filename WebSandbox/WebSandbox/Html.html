            <p>
                HTML enables us to mark up the content to provide it more meaning behind the scenes. This can be used by search engines, screen readers, outlining tools, and readers of our code in general. We can mark a word as an abbreviation, create lists, display code and output, create tables, mark content as quotes, and provide citations. Browsers may or may not implement standard formatting (such as a dotted underline) or standard behavior (such as a tooltip when you hover over that markup) -- but regardless, we can add our own CSS or JavaScript to ensure such things. The point of HTML isn't to get a visual effect. It's to describe and structure your content.

                    Block vs. Inline Tags
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Block level tags break up the flpw of content and take up the full width of their parent container. Inline tags only take up as much space as necessary to render their content.

                            Table: Designed for spreadsheet-style, tabular data, with information stored in individual cells laid out in columns and rows. Once used for page layout purposes, the adoption of CSS encourages tables to only be used grids of information for quick scanning, analysis, and comparison.

                        <li>
